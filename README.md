# Setup

1. Install `stow`: `sudo apt install stow`
2. Clone this repository to your home directory.
3. Navigate to the repository's directory, then run `stow {directory}` to
    symlink the configurations in `{directory}`.
    - Symlinks can't target existing files/directories, so if you run into any
        errors when stowing, it's likely because one or more of the targets
        already exist
    - Exceptions:
        - [`libinput-gestures-touchpad-config`](#libinput-gestures--libinput-gestures-touchpad-config)
        - [`backups`](#backups)

## Additional information

### `backups`

Not meant to be symlinked; it contains files that either aren't configurations
or that must be imported into Windows programs.

### `bash`

I've included "(custom)" as a comment above things I've added or modified in my
`.bashrc` for easy searching.

### `git`

#### `.git-templates`

Any repositories cloned after this setup should automatically be configured to
execute the commit hook.

To use the commit hook in repositories you cloned before setting up the hook,
navigate to their containing directories and run `git init`.

You can test that the commit hook is working by creating a new branch and
adding a commit to it. If the hook is working, the commit message should look
like `[branch_name] Commit message`.

##### Setting up the commit hook manually

1. Copy the `.git-templates` directory to your home directory (or somewhere
    else, if you're a degenerate).
2. Run `git config --global init.templatedir "path/to/.git-templates"` to update
    your git config.

If you make any changes to an existing global hook, (`git init` will not
overwrite the hook defined in your git repo)[https://coderwall.com/p/jp7d5q/create-a-global-git-commit-hook].
You just gotta delete the offending file(s) from the local repo before
running `git init`.

### `libinput-gestures` / `libinput-gestures-touchpad-config`

[GitHub](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures)

Stow `libinput-gestures-touchpad-config` with
`sudo stow --target=/etc libinput-gestures-touchpad-config`.

Stow `libinput-gestures` like normal.

When you change the gestures, use `libinput-gestures-setup restart` to load them.
